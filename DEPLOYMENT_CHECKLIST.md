# Deployment Checklist - Performance Optimizations

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] ESLint warnings addressed
- [x] Performance optimizations implemented
- [x] Error boundaries added
- [x] Mobile optimizations integrated

### ✅ Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test session creation on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome)
- [ ] Test WebRTC connection establishment
- [ ] Verify media access works with fallbacks
- [ ] Test error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Validate performance monitoring
- [ ] Check memory usage on mobile devices

### ✅ Configuration
- [ ] Verify TURN server configuration
- [ ] Check WebRTC settings for production
- [ ] Validate environment variables
- [ ] Confirm analytics integration

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build and Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring Setup
- Enable performance monitoring in production if needed:
  ```javascript
  localStorage.setItem('harthio_performance_monitor', 'true')
  ```

### 3. Monitor Key Metrics
After deployment, monitor:
- Session initialization times
- WebRTC connection success rates
- Error rates by device type
- Memory usage patterns
- User experience metrics

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Critical Paths to Test
1. **Session Creation Flow**
   - Create session → Join session → Video call
   - Test on iOS Safari (most problematic)
   - Test on Android Chrome
   - Test on desktop browsers

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Simulate network issues
   - Test media permission denials
   - Verify error boundary functionality

3. **Performance**
   - Check session load times
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Validate timeout handling

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Session initialization < 10 seconds on mobile
- [ ] No hanging issues on iOS Safari
- [ ] Error recovery works properly
- [ ] Memory usage stays within limits
- [ ] Performance monitoring captures metrics

## Rollback Plan
If issues are detected:
1. Monitor error rates and performance metrics
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify WebRTC connection success rates
4. If critical issues found, rollback to previous version
5. Investigate issues in staging environment

## Monitoring Dashboard
Set up alerts for:
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow session initialization (>15 seconds)
- Memory usage spikes
- WebRTC connection failures

## Support Documentation
Update support docs with:
- New error messages and solutions
- Mobile-specific troubleshooting
- Performance optimization benefits
- Browser compatibility information
