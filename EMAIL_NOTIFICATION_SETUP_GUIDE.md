# üìß Email Notification System Setup Guide

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive email notification system that follows your specified flow:

1. **User A Sends Request** ‚Üí Email to User B
2. **User B Approves Request** ‚Üí Email to both User A and User B
3. **User B Declines Request** ‚Üí Email to User A
4. **User A Cancels Request** ‚Üí Email to User B
5. **Video Call Initiation** ‚Üí No emails (in-app notifications only)

## üöÄ What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ **Files Created/Updated:**

1. **`src/lib/email-service.ts`** - Complete email service with beautiful HTML templates
2. **`src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`** - API endpoint for sending emails
3. **`src/lib/notification-service.ts`** - Enhanced with email integration
4. **`src/lib/supabase-services.ts`** - Updated request flow with email notifications

### ‚úÖ **Email Templates Created:**

- **New Request Email** - Sent to User B when User A sends request
- **Request Approved Email** - Sent to User A when approved
- **Request Approved Confirmation** - Sent to User B as confirmation
- **Request Declined Email** - Sent to User A when declined
- **Request Cancelled Email** - Sent to User B when User A cancels

## üîß Setup Required From Your End

### **Step 1: Choose Email Service Provider**

You have several options:

#### **Option A: Supabase Auth SMTP (Recommended)**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Settings > SMTP Settings**
3. Configure your SMTP provider (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
4. The current API will automatically use this

#### **Option B: Resend (Popular for Next.js)**

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Install: `npm install resend`
4. Update the API route to use Resend

#### **Option C: SendGrid**

1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Install: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
4. Update the API route to use SendGrid

### **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**

Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Email Service Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE_PROVIDER=supabase  # or 'resend' or 'sendgrid'
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key_here  # if using Resend
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key_here  # if using SendGrid
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@harthio.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Harthio
```

### **Step 3: Test Email Functionality**

The system is currently in **development mode** - emails are logged to console instead of sent. To test:

1. **Create a test session**
2. **Send a join request**
3. **Check your server console** - you'll see the email content logged
4. **Once you configure an email provider**, emails will be sent automatically

### **Step 4: Production Configuration**

For production, update `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts` with your chosen provider:

#### **For Resend:**

```typescript
import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

// Replace the email sending logic with:
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Harthio <noreply@harthio.com>",
  to: [to],
  subject: subject,
  html: html,
  text: text,
});
```

#### **For SendGrid:**

```typescript
import sgMail from "@sendgrid/mail";

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!);

// Replace the email sending logic with:
await sgMail.send({
  to: to,
  from: "noreply@harthio.com",
  subject: subject,
  html: html,
  text: text,
});
```
