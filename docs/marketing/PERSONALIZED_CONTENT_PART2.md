```
In 2023, my life changed forever.

A terrible accident. 2 years in hospital. Amputation 3 months ago.

During recovery, I desperately needed to talk to people who understood. But I couldn't find them.

So I built Harthio - the platform I needed but couldn't find.

A place where you can connect with people who truly get what you're going through.

No one should face their struggles alone.

Free to join. Link in bio 💙

### Post #2: The Mission
**Image:** Feature screenshot
**Caption:**
```
"How do you find the right person to talk to, when you need them the most?"

That question defined 2 years of my life.

After my accident and amputation, I needed specific conversations. With people who understood. With founders who could help me reimagine my future.

But there was no platform for that.

So I built Harthio.

Now no one has to search alone.
