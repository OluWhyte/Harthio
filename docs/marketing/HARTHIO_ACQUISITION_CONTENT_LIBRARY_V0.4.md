### Thread Template: Why I Built Harthio
```
1/ Why I built Harthio 🧵

After my [personal struggle], I realized something:

The best support doesn't come from experts.

It comes from people who've been there.

2/ I tried everything:
- Therapy ($$$)
- Support groups (awkward)
- Online forums (anonymous)
- Friends (didn't get it)

Nothing worked.

3/ So I built Harthio.

A platform where you can schedule real conversations with people who've walked your path.

4/ How it works:
- Post what you want to talk about
- Someone who's experienced it requests to join
- Schedule a video call
- Have a real conversation

5/ It's free. It's simple. It works.

If you've ever felt alone in your struggles, check it out.

#### Post #1: Founder Story
```
I launched Harthio today, and I want to share why.

Two years into building my startup, I realized something: founder loneliness is real, and nobody talks about it.

You can't vent to your team (you're the leader).
Your friends don't get it ("just quit if it's so hard").
Your family worries.
And therapy is expensive.

So I built Harthio - a complete support platform for founders:

🤝 Real conversations with founders who've been there
🤖 24/7 AI companion for late-night stress
📊 Track your startup journey & mental health
📈 Monitor burnout signals before they become critical
✅ Daily wellness check-ins

Not networking. Not mentorship programs. Real support when you need it.

Whether you need someone to talk to, AI guidance at 2am, or tools to track your mental health - it's all there.

It's free, and we're live: harthio.com

If you're a founder who's ever felt alone in your journey, check it out.

And if you know a founder who might benefit, please share.

#Founders #StartupLife #MentalHealth #Entrepreneurship
```

#### Post #2: Career Change
```
Career change is terrifying.

Not because of the work. Because you're doing it alone.

You don't know anyone who's made the transition you're considering.
Google gives generic advice.
LinkedIn is full of highlight reels.

So I built Harthio - a complete support platform for career changers:

🤝 Talk to people who've made the transition
🤖 Get AI guidance on career decisions 24/7
📊 Track your job search & interview progress
📈 Monitor stress & confidence levels
✅ Daily check-ins to stay motivated

Real conversations. Real advice. Real tools. Real support.

It's free: harthio.com

If you're considering a career change, this might help.

#CareerChange #CareerDevelopment #ProfessionalGrowth
```

#### Post #3: Work-Life Balance
```
"How do you balance it all?"

As a working parent, I hear this question a lot.

The truth? I don't always. And that's okay.

But what helps is talking to other working parents who get it. Not advice. Not judgment. Just understanding.

That's why I built Harthio - a platform for meaningful conversations with people who truly understand your struggles.

Whether you're a working parent, a career changer, a founder, or anyone dealing with something challenging - there's someone who's been there.

Free to join: harthio.com

#WorkLifeBalance #WorkingParents #MentalHealth
```

#### Post #4: Problem Awareness
```
The loneliness epidemic isn't just about being alone.

It's about feeling alone in your struggles.

You're surrounded by people, but nobody truly understands what you're going through.

That's the problem I built Harthio to solve.

A platform where you can schedule real conversations with people who've walked your path.

Founders talking to founders.
Single parents supporting single parents.
Career changers helping career changers.

Real connections. Real support. Real understanding.

**Example Comments:**
```
"This resonates so much. I built Harthio specifically to address this - connecting people who've been through similar struggles. The power of peer support is incredible."
```

```
"Absolutely agree. Sometimes the best support comes from someone who's walked your path, not an expert. That's why peer-to-peer connections are so powerful."

### Facebook Post Template #1 (After 1 week in group)
```
Hey everyone!

I've been part of this community for a bit and love the support here.

I wanted to share something I built that might help some of you.

It's called Harthio - a platform where you can connect with people who truly understand what you're going through.

I built it because I felt alone in my struggles and couldn't find anyone who got it.

If you've ever felt that way, check it out: harthio.com

It's free, and I'd love your feedback!

[Only post if group rules allow]
```

### Facebook Comment Strategy
- Comment on 5-10 posts daily
- Provide genuine value
- Don't promote unless directly relevant
- Build relationships first
