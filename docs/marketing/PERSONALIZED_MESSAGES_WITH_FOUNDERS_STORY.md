### Template #1: The Full Story (For Close Contacts)
```
Hey [Name]! 👋

I wanted to share something personal with you.

Three months ago, I made one of the hardest decisions of my life. After a 2-year fight following a terrible accident, I had to have an amputation to save my life.

During those long days and nights in the hospital, I desperately needed to talk to people who understood what I was going through. But finding those specific conversations was nearly impossible.

That's why I built Harthio.

It's the platform I needed but couldn't find - a place where you can connect with people who truly get what you're going through.

Whether you're facing health challenges, career uncertainty, life transitions, or anything else - there's someone who's been there.

Would you check it out? harthio.com

And if you know anyone who's struggling and needs someone who understands, please share.

```

### Template #2: The Short Version (For Acquaintances)
```
Hey [Name],

I finally launched something I've been working on and wanted to share with you.

After spending 2 years in recovery, I experienced firsthand how hard it is to find the right person to talk to when you need them most.

So I built Harthio - a platform where you can connect with people who truly understand what you're going through.

It's free: harthio.com

Would love your feedback!

- Seyi
```

### Template #3: For People Facing Health Challenges
```
Hi [Name],

I heard about [their situation] and wanted to reach out.

I spent 2 years fighting through recovery from an accident, and I know how isolating it can be. The physical pain is one thing, but not having people who truly understand is another.

I built Harthio specifically for moments like this - to connect people who are going through similar struggles.

If you ever need to talk to someone who gets it, check it out: harthio.com

You don't have to go through this alone.

- Seyi
```

### Template #4: For Entrepreneurs/Founders
```
Hey [Name]!

After my accident and 2-year recovery, I had to completely reimagine my future. I desperately needed to talk to founders and innovators who could help me brainstorm what's next.

But there was no platform to find those specific conversations.

So I built Harthio.

Whether you're pivoting, struggling, or just need to talk to someone who understands the founder journey - there's someone waiting to connect.

The hardest part of my 2-year recovery wasn't the physical pain.

### Tweet #3: The Mission
```
After losing my legs, I had to reimagine my entire future.

I needed conversations with founders, innovators, people who could help me see what's possible.

### Tweet #4: The Turning Point
```
3 months ago, I made the impossible decision:

Amputation to save my life.

"What can I build now?"

I needed people to talk to. But couldn't find them.

So I built Harthio.

Now no one has to search alone.

```

### Tweet #5: Why It Matters
```
During 2 years of recovery, I learned something:

The right conversation at the right time can change everything.

### Post #1: The Full Founder Story
```
I'm launching Harthio today, and I need to tell you why.

In 2023, my life changed in an instant. A terrible accident broke both of my legs. What should have been a recovery turned into a two-year fight for my life.

Three months ago, I made the impossible decision to have an amputation.

The physical pain was one thing. But the isolation was another.

There were so many days and nights where I just needed to talk to someone who understood—not just a doctor, but another human being who could sit with me in that struggle.

That person was incredibly hard to find.

As I began to heal, a new need emerged. My old life was gone. My mind was racing with questions about my future:

'What can I build now? What am I still capable of? Who am I, after all of this?'

I desperately needed to talk to founders, to innovators, to people who could help me brainstorm the next chapter of my life.

But once again, I hit a wall.

There was no platform to find those specific, meaningful conversations. There was no way to say, 'I need to talk about this, with someone like you, right now.'

That wall is the reason Harthio exists.

I built the platform I needed but couldn't find. A place where no one has to face their biggest challenges, or brainstorm their brightest ideas, alone.

Harthio is more than an app to me. It's the answer to a question that defined two of the hardest years of my life:

'How do you find the right person to talk to, when you need them the most?'

If you've ever felt that need, Harthio is for you.

And if you know someone who's struggling to find their person, please share this with them.

We're live: harthio.com

```

### Post #2: The Lesson
```
Two years in a hospital bed taught me something:

The most valuable conversations aren't with the most successful people.

They're with people who've struggled like you.

During my recovery from a life-changing accident, I needed people who understood. Not experts. Not motivational speakers. Just people who'd been there.

But I couldn't find them.

So I built Harthio - a platform where you can connect with people who truly get what you're going through.

Whether you're facing health challenges, career transitions, founder burnout, or life changes - there's someone who's walked your path.

Free to join: harthio.com

Because no one should face their struggles alone.

#PeerSupport #MentalHealth #Community
```

### Post #3: The Pivot
```
3 months ago, I lost my legs.

Today, I'm launching a platform that could help millions.

Here's what I learned about pivoting when everything changes:

After my amputation, I had to completely reimagine my future. The old plans were gone. The old identity was gone.

I needed conversations with people who could help me see what's possible. Founders who'd pivoted. Innovators who'd rebuilt. People who'd faced impossible odds.

But there was no platform to find them.

So I built Harthio.

It's not just for people facing health challenges. It's for anyone who needs to talk to someone who truly understands:

- Founders pivoting their startups
- Professionals changing careers
- Parents navigating new challenges
- Anyone facing a major life transition

The right conversation can change everything.

Hey [Name],

I wanted to share something personal with you before I share it with the world.

Three months ago, I made one of the hardest decisions of my life. After a 2-year fight following a terrible accident in 2023, I had to have an amputation to save my life.

During those long days and nights, I experienced something I never expected: profound isolation.

Not from lack of people, but from lack of the *right* people to talk to.

I needed conversations with people who truly understood what I was going through. Later, as I began to heal, I needed to connect with founders and innovators to help me reimagine my future.

But there was no platform to find those specific, meaningful connections.

So I built one.

Harthio is the platform I needed but couldn't find. A place where you can connect with the right person, at the right time, for the conversations that matter most.

Whether someone is facing health challenges, career uncertainty, life transitions, or just needs someone who gets it - they can find them on Harthio.

It's free, and we just launched: harthio.com

Would mean the world if you'd:
1. Check it out (even just to give feedback)
2. Share with anyone who might need it

Thank you for being part of my journey. This wouldn't exist without the support of people like you.

With gratitude,
Seyi

P.S. - If you know anyone who's struggling and needs someone who truly understands, please share Harthio with them. It could change everything.
```

### Email #2: To Professional Network
**Subject:** From hospital bed to helping millions

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I wanted to share something I've been working on that came from a deeply personal place.

In 2023, a terrible accident put me in a hospital bed for 2 years. Three months ago, I had to make the impossible decision to have an amputation.

During that time, I experienced firsthand how hard it is to find the right person to talk to when you need them most.

I needed people who understood my struggle. Later, I needed founders and innovators to help me reimagine my future.

But there was no platform to find those specific conversations.

So I built Harthio.

It's a platform where people can connect with others who truly understand what they're going through. Whether it's:

- Health challenges
- Career transitions
- Founder struggles
- Life changes
- Or anything else

There's someone who's been there and wants to help.

It's free to use: harthio.com

I'd love your thoughts, and if you know anyone who might benefit, please share.

Best,
Seyi

P.S. - This isn't just another social app. It's the solution to a problem I lived through. Every feature was built with real human need in mind.
