# WebRTC Implementation Guide

## Overview
Complete WebRTC video calling system with peer-to-peer connections, signaling, and TURN server support.

## Implementation Status
✅ WebRTC Manager - Handles peer connections
✅ Signaling Service - Manages offer/answer/ICE exchange  
✅ Database Setup - Signaling table with RLS policies
✅ Session Integration - Real video calling in sessions
✅ Presence System - User join/leave tracking
✅ Connection Quality - Visual indicators (HD/SD/Low)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Database Setup
Run `database/setup-webrtc.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
- Creates signaling table for WebRTC negotiation
- Sets up session presence tracking
- Configures RLS policies for security
- Enables real-time subscriptions

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```env
# COTURN Server (Primary)
NEXT_PUBLIC_COTURN_URL=turn:your-server.com:3478
NEXT_PUBLIC_COTURN_USERNAME=your-username
NEXT_PUBLIC_COTURN_CREDENTIAL=your-password

# Backup STUN/TURN servers configured automatically
```

### 3. Test Implementation
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a session as User A
3. Join with User B in different browser
4. Verify real WebRTC connection

## Connection Flow
1. User A joins → Gets media → Waits
2. User B joins → Gets media → Starts negotiation
3. Signaling exchange via Supabase real-time
4. P2P connection established
5. Quality monitoring and reconnection

## Features
- Real peer-to-peer video calling
- Automatic fallback servers
- Mobile and desktop support
- Corporate firewall handling
- Connection quality indicators
- User presence tracking
- Leave/rejoin functionality

## Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for WebRTC logs
- Verify COTURN server accessibility
- Ensure camera/microphone permissions
- Test with different networks/devices
