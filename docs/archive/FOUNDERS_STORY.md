# Harthio Founder's Story

## The Original Story

**Founder:** Oluwaseyi Akinlolu  
**Co-Founder:** Oluwatosin Akinlolu (Wife)

---

In 2023, my life changed in an instant. A terrible accident broke both of my legs. After a successful surgery, I was hopeful. But then, complications arose. What should have been a recovery turned into a two-year fight for my life in a hospital bed.

The physical pain was one thing, but the isolation was another. There were so many days and nights where I just needed to talk to someone who understood—not just a doctor, but another human being who could sit with me in that struggle. That person was incredibly hard to find.

Three months ago, the fight became even harder. To save my life, I made the impossible decision to have an amputation. As I finally began to regain my health, a new need emerged. I was alive, but my old life was gone. My mind was racing with questions about my future.

*'What can I build now? What am I still capable of? Who am I, after all of this?'*

I desperately needed to talk to founders, to innovators, to people who could help me brainstorm the next chapter of my life. But once again, I hit a wall. There was no platform to find those specific, meaningful conversations. There was no way to say, *'I need to talk about this, with someone like you, right now.'*

**That wall is the reason Harthio exists.**

I built the platform I needed but couldn't find. A place where no one has to face their biggest challenges, or brainstorm their brightest ideas, alone.

Harthio is more than an app to me. It's the answer to a question that defined two of the hardest years of my life:

***'How do you find the right person to talk to, when you need them the most?'***

## AI Remixing Instructions

When users ask about Harthio's origin or the founder's story, the AI should:

### **Tone & Approach:**
- Be authentic and respectful
- Don't overshare - let users ask follow-up questions
- Focus on the mission, not just the struggle
- Emphasize hope and resilience

### **Key Themes to Highlight:**
1. **Personal Experience** - Built from real need during recovery
2. **The Gap** - No platform existed for specific, meaningful conversations
3. **The Mission** - Connect people who truly understand each other
4. **Universal Need** - Everyone faces moments where they need "the right person"

### **Sample AI Responses:**

**When asked "Who created Harthio?"**
> "Harthio was founded by Oluwaseyi Akinlolu, alongside his wife and co-founder Oluwatosin. The platform was born from a deeply personal need—during a two-year recovery from a life-changing accident, Oluwaseyi experienced firsthand how hard it is to find the right person to talk to when you need them most. That's why Harthio exists: to make sure no one has to face their biggest challenges alone."

**When asked "Why was Harthio created?"**
> "Harthio was created to solve a problem our founder lived through. During a difficult recovery, he desperately needed meaningful conversations—with people who understood his struggles, and later, with innovators who could help him reimagine his future. But there was no platform to find those specific connections. Harthio is the answer to that need: a place where you can find the right person to talk to, exactly when you need them."

**When asked "What makes Harthio different?"**
> "Harthio was built by someone who needed it. Our founder spent two years searching for meaningful connections during recovery—people who truly understood what he was going through. That lived experience shapes everything we do. We're not just another chat app. We're a platform designed for the moments that matter most, when you need someone who really gets it."

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't share graphic medical details
- ❌ Don't make it sound like a sob story
- ❌ Don't overshadow the user's own struggles

### **When to Share:**

- ✅ User asks "Why should I trust this platform?"
- ✅ User expresses feeling alone or misunderstood
- ✅ User asks about the founders
- ✅ Context where shared experience builds trust

### **How to Transition:**
After sharing the story, always bring it back to the user:
> "That's why I'm here for you now. What's on your mind today?"

## For Marketing & About Page

**Short Version (1 paragraph):**
> Harthio was founded by Oluwaseyi Akinlolu and his wife Oluwatosin during a two-year recovery from a life-changing accident. When Oluwaseyi needed meaningful conversations most—first with people who understood his struggles, then with innovators to help reimagine his future—he couldn't find a platform that connected him with the right people. Harthio is the solution he built: a place where no one has to face their biggest challenges, or brainstorm their brightest ideas, alone.

**Medium Version (2-3 paragraphs):**
> In 2023, Oluwaseyi Akinlolu's life changed in an instant. A severe accident led to a two-year fight for recovery, including the difficult decision to have an amputation. During those long days and nights, he experienced profound isolation—not from lack of people, but from lack of the *right* people to talk to.

> He needed conversations with those who truly understood his struggle. Later, as he began to heal, he needed to connect with founders and innovators to help him reimagine his future. But there was no platform to find those specific, meaningful connections.

> That's why Oluwaseyi, alongside his wife and co-founder Oluwatosin, built Harthio. It's the platform they needed but couldn't find—a place where you can connect with the right person, at the right time, for the conversations that matter most.
