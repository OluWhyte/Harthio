# Blog Formatting Guide

## Overview
The Harthio blog system supports simple markdown-style formatting to help you create well-structured, engaging content with headings and links.

## Supported Formatting

### 1. Main Headings (H2)
Use `##` at the start of a line to create a main section heading.

**Syntax:**
```
## Your Main Section Title
```

**Example:**
```
## Getting Started with Harthio
```

**Renders as:** Large, bold heading for major sections

---

### 2. Subheadings (H3)
Use `###` at the start of a line to create a subsection heading.

**Syntax:**
```
### Your Subsection Title
```

**Example:**
```
### Step 1: Create Your Account
```

**Renders as:** Medium, semibold heading for subsections

---

### 3. Links
Use `[text](url)` to create clickable links.

**Syntax:**
```
[link text](url)
```

**Examples:**

**Internal Links** (within Harthio):
```
[Sign up now](/signup)
[View your dashboard](/dashboard)
[Browse sessions](/sessions)
[Login here](/login)
```

**External Links** (to other websites):
```
[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/harthio_)
[Read our privacy policy](https://harthio.com/privacy)
[Contact support](mailto:support@harthio.com)
```

**Renders as:** Clickable, underlined links in primary color
- Internal links open in the same tab
- External links open in a new tab

---

### 4. Paragraphs
Just write normally! Each line break creates a new paragraph.

**Example:**
```
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

This is the third paragraph.
```
