# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to prevent hanging issues, especially on Chrome iOS, and ensure smooth operation across all devices and browsers.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. WebRTC Connection Hanging
**Problem**: WebRTC connections would hang during initialization, especially on iOS Safari and Chrome mobile.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added timeout wrappers for all WebRTC operations
- Implemented progressive fallback strategies for media access
- Added mobile-specific WebRTC configurations
- Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Added connection state throttling to prevent rapid state changes

### 2. Memory Leaks and Resource Management
**Problem**: Poor cleanup of WebRTC connections, real-time subscriptions, and media streams.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Comprehensive cleanup functions with proper error handling
- Parallel cleanup operations with timeouts
- Memory monitoring and automatic cleanup triggers
- Proper disposal of media tracks and peer connections

### 3. Blocking Operations
**Problem**: Synchronous operations blocking the main thread, causing UI freezes.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Non-blocking initialization with `Promise.allSettled`
- Use of `requestIdleCallback` and `requestAnimationFrame` for better performance
- Timeout wrappers for all async operations
- Background processing for non-critical operations

### 4. Excessive Real-time Subscriptions
**Problem**: Multiple real-time subscriptions causing performance degradation.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Optimized debouncing with mobile-specific delays
- Intelligent filtering to reduce unnecessary updates
- Connection health monitoring and automatic recovery
- Subscription cleanup and deduplication

## New Components and Utilities

- Performance metrics collection and reporting

### 2. Mobile Optimizations (`src/lib/mobile-optimizations.ts`)
- Device capability detection
- Mobile-specific timeout and debounce calculations
- Optimized WebRTC and media configurations
- Background/foreground state management
- Memory cleanup triggers

### 3. Error Boundary (`src/components/common/error-boundary.tsx`)
- Comprehensive error catching and recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Error reporting and analytics integration

## Specific Optimizations by Component

### WebRTC Manager (`src/lib/webrtc-manager.ts`)
- **Timeout Management**: Mobile-optimized timeouts (iOS: 45s, Android: 30s, Desktop: 20s)

- **Memory-Conscious Operations**: Uses `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical updates

### Media Utils (`src/lib/media-utils.ts`)
- **Timeout Wrappers**: Prevents `getUserMedia` from hanging
- **Progressive Fallback**: Multiple strategies for media access
- **Mobile-Specific Constraints**: Optimized video/audio settings for mobile devices
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: User-friendly error descriptions with device-specific guidance

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations
