# ðŸ“§ Resend Email Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your Resend API Key

1. **Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)**
2. **Go to your dashboard**
3. **Navigate to "API Keys" section**
4. **Click "Create API Key"**
5. **Copy the key** (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Update Your Environment Variables

Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` in your `.env.local` file:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=Harthio <no-reply@harthio.com>
```

### 3. (Optional) Verify Your Domain

For better deliverability and to use `no-reply@harthio.com`:

1. **In Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"**
2. **Click "Add Domain"**
3. **Enter `harthio.com`**
4. **Add the DNS records** they provide to your domain
5. **Wait for verification** (usually takes a few minutes)

Without domain verification, emails will be sent from a Resend subdomain but will still work.

### 4. Test the System

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
npm run dev
node test-email-system.js
```
