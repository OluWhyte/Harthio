# Session Debug Guide

## üîç Issues Fixed

### 1. **Repeated "Failed to load session data" notifications** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: useEffect dependency array causing infinite re-renders
- **Solution**: Removed unstable dependencies (`webrtcCallbacks`, `addSystemMessage`) from useEffect
- **Added**: Component mount tracking to prevent state updates after unmount

### 2. **WebRTC Signaling State Errors** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: `createAnswer` called in wrong signaling state
- **Solution**: Added proper state checking before creating offers/answers
- **Added**: Better error handling that doesn't spam users with technical errors

### 3. **Connection Error Spam** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Every signaling error shown to user
- **Solution**: Filter technical errors, only show user-actionable messages
- **Added**: Automatic suggestion to switch to Jitsi when WebRTC fails

## üõ†Ô∏è Debug Steps

### Check Session Loading
1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to session page
3. Look for these logs:
   ```
   Loading session data for: [sessionId]
   Loaded topics: [number]
   Found current topic: true/false
   ```

### Check WebRTC Connection
1. Look for connection state logs:
   ```
   Connection state changed: initializing
   Connection state changed: connecting
   Connection state changed: connected
   ```

### Check Signaling
1. Look for signaling logs:
   ```
   Handling offer in state: stable
   Received offer, setting remote description
   ```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Session Not Found"
**Cause**: Session ID doesn't exist in database
**Solution**: 
1. Check if session exists in topics table
2. Verify user has permission to join
3. Check session hasn't expired

### Issue: "Connection failed after multiple attempts"
**Cause**: WebRTC connection issues (firewall, NAT, etc.)
**Solution**: 
1. Click "Switch to Jitsi" button in top controls
2. Jitsi will provide reliable fallback connection

### Issue: "Camera/microphone access denied"
**Cause**: Browser permissions not granted
**Solution**:
1. Click camera/microphone icon in browser address bar
2. Allow permissions
3. Refresh page

### Issue: Signaling errors in console
**Cause**: WebRTC state management issues
**Solution**: 
- These are now handled automatically
- Users won't see technical errors
- Connection will retry or suggest Jitsi fallback
