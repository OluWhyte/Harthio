# Video Provider Upgrade 2025

## üéØ Objective
Improve video calling reliability for Harthio users, especially those on African mobile networks, by implementing intelligent provider selection and fallback mechanisms.

## üöÄ What We've Implemented

### 1. **Video Service Manager** (`src/lib/video-service-manager.ts`)
- **Intelligent Provider Selection**: Automatically tries providers in order of reliability
- **Smart Fallback**: Seamlessly switches providers if one fails
- **Provider Priority** (optimized for African mobile networks):
  1. **Jitsi Meet Public** (`meet.jit.si`) - Most reliable, battle-tested
  2. **Daily.co** - Excellent mobile optimization, 10k minutes/month free
  3. **Jitsi Self-hosted** - Your existing server as backup
  4. **WebRTC Direct** - Last resort peer-to-peer

### 2. **Daily.co Integration** (`src/lib/daily-service.ts`)
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Lower bitrates, adaptive quality for mobile data
- **Bandwidth Management**: Caps at 1.5 Mbps for mobile networks
- **Audio Optimization**: 64 kbps audio, noise cancellation
- **Video Optimization**: 640x360 default, 15fps for mobile

### 3. **Enhanced Jitsi Service** (`src/lib/jitsi-service.ts`)
- **Public Server Priority**: Always uses `meet.jit.si` for reliability
- **Mobile Network Optimizations**:
  - Lower starting bitrate (800 kbps)
  - Reduced resolution (360p default)
  - Optimized audio settings
  - Better P2P configuration

### 4. **Updated Session Page** (`src/app/session/[sessionId]/page.tsx`)
- **Seamless Provider Switching**: Users don't need to do anything
- **Provider Indicators**: Shows which service is being used
- **Automatic Fallback**: Tries next provider if current one fails
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing WebRTC setup still works

### 5. **Connection Diagnostics** (`src/components/session/connection-diagnostics.tsx`)
- **Real-time Status**: Shows current provider and connection quality
- **Mobile Network Tips**: Specific advice for African mobile users
- **Manual Provider Switching**: For testing and troubleshooting

### 6. **Test Interface** (`src/app/test-video/page.tsx`)
- **Provider Testing**: Test each video service independently
- **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time logs and diagnostics
- **Mobile Testing**: Optimized for testing on mobile devices

## üåç African Mobile Network Optimizations

### Bandwidth Management
- **Video**: Capped at 1 Mbps max, starts at 800 kbps
- **Audio**: 64 kbps with noise cancellation
- **Resolution**: Starts at 360p, scales up if bandwidth allows

### Connection Reliability
- **Multiple STUN/TURN servers**: Redundant connectivity options
- **Adaptive Quality**: Automatically adjusts based on network conditions
- **Quick Fallback**: 1-second timeout before trying next provider

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Touch-Optimized Controls**: Better mobile interface
- **Battery Optimization**: Lower CPU usage settings
- **Network Change Handling**: Adapts when switching between WiFi/mobile

## üîß How It Works

### Automatic Provider Selection
```typescript
// Provider priority for African mobile networks
private providerPriority: VideoProvider[] = [
  'jitsi-public',  // Most reliable, battle-tested
  'daily',         // Excellent mobile optimization  
  'jitsi-self',    // Your self-hosted as backup
  'webrtc'         // Last resort
];
```

### Intelligent Fallback
1. **Try Jitsi Public**: Uses meet.jit.si (handles millions of users)
2. **Fallback to Daily.co**: If Jitsi fails, try Daily.co's mobile-optimized servers
3. **Backup to Self-hosted**: Your existing Jitsi server as tertiary option
4. **Last Resort WebRTC**: Direct peer-to-peer connection

### User Experience
- **Transparent**: Users see "Connecting..." then get connected via best available provider
- **Provider Indicator**: Small colored dot shows which service is active
- **System Messages**: Friendly notifications about connection status
- **No Interruption**: Switching happens automatically without user action

## üì± Testing Instructions

### 1. **Quick Test** (Recommended)
Visit `/test-video` page to test each provider independently:
- Test Jitsi Meet Public
- Test Daily.co  
- Test Harthio Video (self-hosted)
- Monitor connection logs

### 2. **Real Session Test**
Create a test session and join from multiple devices:
- Desktop + Mobile
- WiFi + Mobile Data
- Different locations/networks

### 3. **Mobile Network Testing**
Specifically test on African mobile networks:
- MTN, Airtel, Glo, 9mobile (Nigeria)
- Safaricom, Airtel (Kenya)
- Vodacom, MTN (South Africa)

## üéØ Expected Improvements

### Connection Reliability
- **90%+ Success Rate**: Jitsi Public + Daily.co should handle most scenarios
- **Faster Connection**: Reduced time to establish video calls
- **Fewer Reconnections**: Better handling of network changes

### User Experience  
- **Seamless**: Users don't need to understand technical details
- **Faster**: Quicker connection establishment
- **More Reliable**: Multiple fallback options

### Mobile Performance
- **Lower Data Usage**: Optimized bitrates for mobile data
- **Better Quality**: Adaptive quality based on network conditions
- **Stable Connections**: Better handling of mobile network variations

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Screen Sharing**: Add screen sharing via Daily.co
2. **Recording**: Session recording capabilities
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Connection quality metrics
4. **Regional Optimization**: Geo-specific provider selection

### Monitoring & Analytics
1. **Connection Success Rates**: Track which providers work best
2. **Geographic Performance**: Monitor performance by region
3. **Device-Specific Metrics**: Mobile vs desktop performance
4. **Network Quality Correlation**: Match connection quality to network types

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Video Still Fails
1. **Check Network**: Ensure internet connectivity
2. **Try Different Provider**: Use test page to check each service
3. **Browser Permissions**: Verify camera/microphone access
4. **Firewall/Corporate Network**: May block WebRTC traffic

### Common Issues
- **Jitsi Public Blocked**: Some corporate networks block meet.jit.si
- **Daily.co Limits**: Free tier has 10k minutes/month limit
- **Self-hosted Issues**: Your server may have connectivity problems
- **WebRTC NAT Issues**: Some networks don't support peer-to-peer

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure improvement:
- **Connection Success Rate**: % of successful video connections
- **Time to Connect**: Average time from "join" to "connected"
- **Reconnection Frequency**: How often users need to reconnect
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on video call quality
- **Provider Distribution**: Which providers are used most

---

**Result**: Users should experience dramatically improved video calling reliability, especially on African mobile networks, with automatic fallback ensuring connections work even when individual providers fail.
