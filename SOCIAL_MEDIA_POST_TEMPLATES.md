### Post 1: Long-form Story (Founder Journey)
```
I launched Harthio today, and I need to share why.

Two years ago, I was building my startup and felt completely alone.

I couldn't vent to my team (I was supposed to be the leader).
My friends didn't get it ("just quit if it's so hard").
My family worried about me.
And therapy was $200/session.

I needed someone who had been there. Someone who understood.

But I couldn't find them.

So I built Harthio.

It's a platform where you can schedule real conversations with people who've walked your path.

Not networking. Not mentorship programs. Just real conversations with people who understand.

How it works:
→ Post what you want to talk about
→ Someone who's experienced it requests to join
→ Schedule a video call
→ Have a meaningful conversation

It's free, and we're live: harthio.com

If you're a founder who's ever felt alone in your journey, check it out.

And if you know someone who might benefit, please share.

### Post 2: Problem/Solution (Career Change)
```
Career change is terrifying.

Not because of the work.
Because you're doing it alone.

You don't know anyone who's made the transition you're considering.
Google gives generic advice.
LinkedIn is full of highlight reels.

So I built Harthio.

A platform where you can talk to people who've actually made the change you're considering.

Real conversations. Real advice. Real support.

How it works:
1. Post about your career change
2. Someone who's made that transition requests to join
3. Schedule a call
4. Get real insights

It's free: harthio.com

If you're considering a career change, this might help.

### Post 3: Vulnerability (Work-Life Balance)
```
"How do you balance it all?"

As a working parent, I hear this question constantly.

The truth? I don't always. And that's okay.

But what helps is talking to other working parents who get it.

Not advice. Not judgment. Just understanding.

That's why I built Harthio.

A platform for meaningful conversations with people who truly understand your struggles.

Whether you're:
→ A working parent
→ A career changer
→ A founder
→ Anyone dealing with something challenging

There's someone who's been there.

And they want to help.

Free to join: harthio.com

What's something you wish you could talk to someone about who truly understands?

```

### Post 4: Data/Insights
```
I analyzed 100+ conversations on Harthio.

Here's what people are really struggling with:

1. Founder loneliness (32%)
2. Career uncertainty (24%)
3. Work-life balance (18%)
4. Single parenthood (14%)
5. Life transitions (12%)

The common thread?

Everyone felt alone in their struggle.

Until they found someone who'd been there.

That's the power of meaningful connections.

If you're dealing with any of these, check out Harthio: harthio.com

Someone understands. Someone wants to help.

### Post 5: User Story
```
"After my divorce, I felt completely alone.

My friends tried to help, but they didn't understand.

On Harthio, I found someone who had been through the exact same thing.

That conversation changed everything."

- Bode, 42, Single Dad

This is why I built Harthio.

Not for networking. Not for business.

For real human connection with people who truly understand.
