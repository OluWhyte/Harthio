# Mobile Testing Guide for Harthio

This guide helps you test video calling features on mobile devices during development.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: HTTPS Required for Mobile

Mobile browsers require HTTPS for camera/microphone access. We provide two solutions:

## Option 1: HTTPS with Self-Signed Certificates (Recommended)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Generate certificates and start HTTPS server
npm run mobile:https
```

This will:
1. Generate self-signed certificates
2. Configure Next.js for HTTPS
3. Start the development server with HTTPS
4. Display network URLs for mobile access

### Mobile Access Steps
1. Connect your mobile device to the same WiFi network
2. Open browser and go to: `https://[YOUR-IP]:3000`
3. **Accept Security Warning**: Click "Advanced" â†’ "Proceed to [IP] (unsafe)"
4. Allow camera/microphone permissions when prompted
5. Create/join a session to test video calling

### Security Warning Handling
Your browser will show a security warning because we use self-signed certificates. This is normal for development:

**iOS Safari:**
- Tap "Advanced" â†’ "Proceed to [website]"

**Android Chrome:**
- Tap "Advanced" â†’ "Proceed to [IP] (unsafe)"

## Option 2: ngrok Tunnel (Alternative)

If you have ngrok installed:

```bash
# Show ngrok setup instructions
npm run mobile:ngrok

# Or manually:
# Terminal 1: Start regular dev server
npm run dev:mobile

# Terminal 2: Create HTTPS tunnel
ngrok http 3000
```

Use the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok on your mobile device.

## Option 3: HTTP (Limited - Desktop Only)

For desktop testing only:
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

**Note**: This won't work on mobile browsers due to security restrictions.

## Network Access

### Finding Your Network IP
The setup script automatically detects your network IP. Common formats:
- `192.168.1.xxx` (home networks)  
- `172.20.10.xxx` (mobile hotspots)
- `10.0.0.xxx` (corporate networks)

### Firewall Configuration
If mobile devices can't connect, allow Node.js through Windows Firewall:
```bash
# Run as administrator
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Node.js Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
```

## Mobile Browser Compatibility

### Recommended Browsers
- **iOS**: Safari (best compatibility)
- **Android**: Chrome (best compatibility)

### Known Issues
- **iOS Safari**: Requires user interaction to start media
- **Android Chrome**: May need permissions reset if blocked
- **Firefox Mobile**: Limited WebRTC support

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Server
1. âœ… Check both devices are on same WiFi network
2. âœ… Disable VPN on both devices  
3. âœ… Check firewall settings (Windows may block Node.js)
4. âœ… Try HTTPS option: `npm run mobile:https`

### "Media Not Supported" Error
This usually means you're using HTTP instead of HTTPS:
1. âœ… Use HTTPS option: `npm run mobile:https`
2. âœ… Accept security warning on mobile browser
3. âœ… Try different browser (Chrome/Safari work best)

### Camera/Microphone Not Working
1. âœ… **Use HTTPS**: Required for mobile browsers
2. âœ… **Check Permissions**: Ensure browser has camera/mic access
3. âœ… **Refresh Page**: Sometimes permissions need a refresh
4. âœ… **Try Different Browser**: Chrome/Safari work best
5. âœ… **Check Other Apps**: Close apps using camera/mic
6. âœ… **Restart Browser**: Clear cache and restart

### Certificate Errors
1. âœ… **Accept Warning**: Click "Advanced" â†’ "Proceed to site"
2. âœ… **Clear Browser Cache**: Try incognito/private mode
3. âœ… **Regenerate Certificates**: `npm run mobile:https -- --regenerate`

### Poor Video Quality
1. âœ… **Move Closer to Router**: Better WiFi signal improves quality
2. âœ… **Close Other Apps**: Free up device resources  
3. âœ… **Lower Resolution**: App automatically adjusts for mobile

### Connection Fails
1. âœ… **Check Network**: Ensure stable WiFi connection
2. âœ… **Restart App**: Refresh both browser windows
3. âœ… **Check Firewall**: Ensure WebRTC traffic isn't blocked
4. âœ… **Try Different Network**: Some corporate networks block WebRTC

## Development Tips

### Testing Multiple Devices
1. Open the HTTPS network URL on multiple mobile devices
2. Create a session on one device
3. Join from another device to test peer-to-peer connection

### Debugging
- Open browser developer tools on mobile (if available)
- Check console for error messages
- Use the debug info component (shows automatically on mobile)
- Visit `/debug-media` for detailed media testing

### Performance Testing
- Test with different network conditions
- Try with multiple participants
- Monitor CPU/memory usage on mobile devices

## Commands Reference

```bash
# HTTPS mobile testing (recommended)
npm run mobile:https

# Regenerate certificates
npm run mobile:https -- --regenerate

# ngrok alternative
npm run mobile:ngrok

# HTTP only (desktop testing)
npm run dev:mobile

# Setup mobile testing environment
npm run mobile:setup
```

## Security Notes

- Development server only accessible on local network
- Self-signed certificates are safe for development
- Camera/microphone access requires user permission
- HTTPS is required for mobile browser media access

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:
1. âœ… Ensure valid HTTPS certificate (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
2. âœ… Configure proper TURN servers for NAT traversal
3. âœ… Test on various mobile devices and networks
4. âœ… Monitor WebRTC connection quality and fallbacks
