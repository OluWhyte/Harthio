## 📱 PERSONAL OUTREACH MESSAGES

### Message 1: For Entrepreneurs/Founders
```
Hey [Name]!

I finally launched something I've been working on and immediately thought of you.

It's called Harthio - a platform where you can schedule real conversations with people who actually understand what you're going through.

I know how isolating founder life can be (the stress, the uncertainty, the "am I crazy?" moments). I built this so we don't have to figure it all out alone.

Would you try it and let me know what you think? Takes 2 minutes to sign up:
👉 harthio.com/signup

And if you know any other founders who might benefit, please share!

- Tosin
```

### Message 2: For Single Parents
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something with you that I think could really help.

I built Harthio - a platform where you can connect with people who truly understand your journey. Not therapy, not random strangers - just real conversations with people who've been there.

I know being a single parent comes with unique challenges that not everyone gets. On Harthio, you can schedule a conversation with someone who's walked that path.

Would you check it out? It's free:
👉 harthio.com/signup

Would mean a lot to get your feedback!

- Tosin
```

### Message 3: For Career Changers
```
Hey [Name]!

Remember when you mentioned thinking about [career change/new direction]?

I built something that might help - Harthio. It's a platform where you can schedule conversations with people who've made similar transitions.

Instead of googling or feeling stuck, you can talk to someone who's actually done it. Real advice, real support, no BS.

Would you try it? Takes 2 minutes:
👉 harthio.com/signup

Let me know what you think!

- Tosin
```

### Message 4: For Students
```
Hi [Name],

I know college/university can feel overwhelming sometimes (trust me, I've been there).

I built Harthio - a platform where you can connect with people who understand what you're going through. Whether it's academic stress, career anxiety, or just needing someone to talk to.

It's free, and you can schedule conversations with people who've been in your shoes.

Check it out:
👉 harthio.com/signup

Would love your feedback!

- Tosin
```

### Message 5: General (Anyone)
```
Hey [Name]!

I built something I'm really excited about and would love your thoughts.

It's called Harthio - a platform for meaningful conversations with people who truly understand what you're going through.

You know that feeling when you're dealing with something and think "nobody gets it"? Harthio fixes that. You post what you want to talk about, someone who's experienced it requests to join, and you have a real conversation.

It's free. Would you try it?
👉 harthio.com/signup

And if you know anyone who might benefit, please share!

## 🔴 REDDIT POST TEMPLATES

### Reddit Post 1: r/startups, r/Entrepreneur
```
Title: I built a platform for founders who feel alone in their journey

Body:

After 2 years of building my startup, I realized something: founder loneliness is real, and nobody talks about it.

You can't vent to your team (you're supposed to be the leader). Your friends don't get it ("just quit if it's so hard"). Your family worries. And therapy is expensive.

So I built Harthio - a platform where you can schedule real conversations with other founders who've been there.

**How it works:**
- Post what you want to talk about (burnout, difficult co-founder, imposter syndrome, etc.)
- Someone who's experienced it requests to join
- You have a scheduled video call
- No random connections, no small talk - just someone who gets it

It's free, and I'm looking for founders to test it.

If you've ever felt like "nobody understands what I'm going through," this might help.

Would love your feedback!

### Reddit Post 2: r/CasualConversation, r/NeedAFriend
```
Title: I built something for people who feel alone in their struggles

Body:

Ever feel like you're going through something and nobody around you truly understands?

I felt that way after my divorce. Friends tried to help, but unless you've been through it, you just don't get it.

So I built Harthio - a platform where you can find someone who's actually walked your path.

**It's simple:**
- You post what you want to talk about
- Someone who's experienced it requests to join
- You schedule a video call
- Have a real conversation with someone who gets it

Not therapy. Not random strangers. Just meaningful conversations with people who understand.

It's free, and I'm looking for people to test it.

Topics people are talking about:
- Single parenthood
- Career changes
- Founder burnout
- Life after 30
- College stress
- Divorce recovery

Link: harthio.com

If this resonates, check it out. Would love your feedback!

### Reddit Post 3: r/SingleParents
```
Title: Built a platform to connect with other single parents who get it

Body:

Being a single parent is hard. And sometimes you just need to talk to someone who understands - not advice, not judgment, just someone who's been there.

I built Harthio for exactly this. It's a platform where you can schedule conversations with other single parents.

**How it works:**
- Post what you want to talk about (co-parenting struggles, dating as a single parent, managing it all, etc.)
- Another single parent requests to join
- You have a scheduled video call
- Real conversation, real support

It's free. No random connections. Just people who truly understand.

Link: harthio.com

If you've ever felt alone in this journey, check it out.

Would love your feedback!

### Reddit Post 4: r/careerguidance
```
Title: Made a platform to talk to people who've made the career change you're considering

Body:

Thinking about a career change but don't know anyone who's done it?

I built Harthio - a platform where you can schedule conversations with people who've made similar transitions.

**Instead of:**
- Googling endlessly
- Feeling stuck
- Making decisions in isolation

**You can:**
- Talk to someone who's actually done it
- Get real advice (not generic LinkedIn posts)
- Ask the questions you're afraid to ask

It's free. You post what you want to talk about, someone who's made that transition requests to join, and you have a real conversation.

Link: harthio.com

If you're considering a change, this might help.

Looking for people to test it - would love your feedback!

## 💼 LINKEDIN POST TEMPLATES

### LinkedIn Post 1: Founder Story
```
I launched Harthio today, and I want to share why.

Two years into building my startup, I realized something: founder loneliness is real, and nobody talks about it.

You can't vent to your team (you're the leader).
Your friends don't get it ("just quit if it's so hard").
Your family worries.
And therapy is expensive.

So I built Harthio - a platform where founders can schedule real conversations with other founders who've been there.

Not networking. Not mentorship programs. Just real conversations with people who understand.

It's free, and we're live: harthio.com

If you're a founder who's ever felt alone in your journey, check it out.

And if you know a founder who might benefit, please share.

### LinkedIn Post 2: Career Change
```
Career change is terrifying.

Not because of the work. Because you're doing it alone.

You don't know anyone who's made the transition you're considering.
Google gives generic advice.
LinkedIn is full of highlight reels.

So I built Harthio - a platform where you can talk to people who've actually made the change you're considering.

Real conversations. Real advice. Real support.

It's free: harthio.com

If you're considering a career change, this might help.

### LinkedIn Post 3: Work-Life Balance
```
"How do you balance it all?"

As a working parent, I hear this question a lot.

The truth? I don't always. And that's okay.

But what helps is talking to other working parents who get it. Not advice. Not judgment. Just understanding.

That's why I built Harthio - a platform for meaningful conversations with people who truly understand your struggles.

Whether you're a working parent, a career changer, a founder, or anyone dealing with something challenging - there's someone who's been there.

### LinkedIn Post 4: Problem Awareness
```
The loneliness epidemic isn't just about being alone.

It's about feeling alone in your struggles.

You're surrounded by people, but nobody truly understands what you're going through.

That's the problem I built Harthio to solve.

A platform where you can schedule real conversations with people who've walked your path.

Founders talking to founders.
Single parents supporting single parents.
Career changers helping career changers.

Real connections. Real support. Real understanding.

Hey [Name],

I wanted to share something with you personally before I blast it everywhere.

I built Harthio - a platform for meaningful conversations with people who truly understand what you're going through.
