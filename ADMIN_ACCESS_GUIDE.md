# 📝 Blog Admin Access Guide

## 🔐 How to Access the Admin Panel

### Step 1: Set Up Your Admin Account

1. **Create a user account** on your platform (sign up normally)
2. **Get your user ID** from the database or use your email
3. **Run this SQL command** in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email
INSERT INTO admin_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT id, 'admin'
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Step 2: Access the Admin Panel

Once you're set up as an admin, you have **two ways** to access the blog admin:

#### Option 1: From the Blog Page

1. Go to `/blog`
2. Log in with your admin account
3. You'll see a **"Manage Blog Posts"** button at the top
4. Click it to go to the admin panel

#### Option 2: Direct Access

1. Log in to your account
2. Go directly to `/blog/admin`
3. The admin panel will load automatically
